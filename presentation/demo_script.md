# K8s Failure Prediction System Demo Script

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure you're in the project root directory:
```bash
cd k8s-failure-prediction
```

## Demo Flow

### 1. Data Collection (2-3 minutes)

```bash
python data_collector.py
```

Expected output:
- Dataset generation message
- Statistics about normal vs failure cases
- Confirmation of CSV file creation

### 2. Model Training (3-4 minutes)

```bash
python train_model.py
```

Key points to highlight:
